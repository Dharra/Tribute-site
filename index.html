Eduardo Gory "Eddie" Guerrero Llanes (October 9, 1967 – November 13, 2005) The incomparable Eddie Guerrero, has made his mark on sports entertainment like no one before or after him. Before his untimely death, Eddie has held not just championships, but monikers that distinguished him from everyone else. “Latino Heat”, “Master of the counter”, Mr. “I LIE, I CHEAT, I STEAL”, and last and most fitting, “WWE Hall of Famer”. The illustrious career of El Paso’s own has had its share of road blocks, low points, and resurgence. As a man of faith and family, Eddie Guerrero has stayed true to his war cry, “Viva La Raza!”. Taking God, family, and pure skill, and laying it out in the ring for some of the most memorable matches and moments. I would like to honor one of my favorite wrestlers of all time with this tribute page, and a list of his many accolades.

  <p>On April 1, 2006, Eddie Guerrero was forever immortalized in the WWE Hall of Fame. He was inducted by friends Rey Mysterio, Chris Benoit and nephew Chavo. It was an emotional moment as his wife Vickie made her way to the stage to accept the honor on her late husband's behalf.

    The night served as a celebration of Guerrero's career, a career that saw him fall to the darkest depths and rise to the greatest heights imaginable.
    
    Guerrero, despite his lack of size, proved to the wrestling world that a Superstar with unquestionable heart, unmistakable charisma and outstanding in-ring ability could still succeed at the highest level possible.
    
    He achieved greatness in every company he ever competed in and exceeded the lofty expectations set for him by the father and brothers who came before him.
    
    Guerrero's legacy is one of phenomenal matches, incredible lows and tremendous highs. He became a role model for a generation of fans who appreciated that he was able to overcome the demons that nearly destroyed everything he ever built for himself—both in his professional and personal life.
    
    He was, arguably, the most complete professional wrestler of his generation, and his work will live on forever thanks to WWE's extensive video library and the home video releases it has produced celebrating his life and career.
    
    The Guerrero lives on, thanks to his wife Vickie, who has become one of the most entertaining villains of the last decade, and his daughter Shaul who, under the name Raquel Diaz, recently returned to WWE's developmental program.</p>
